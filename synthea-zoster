-- For a data visualization for this project, go here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.moy/viz/ZosterVaccinationRate-SyntheticData/ZosterDashboard

-- The data can be found here: https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads
-- About the data: fake; synthetically generated via Synthea. Dates go up to the end of 2021.

-- Goals:
-- 1) Find total % of active patients getting Zoster shots, stratified by age, race, county, overall
-- 2) Find running total of Zoster shots
-- 3) Find total number of Zoster shots given
-- 4) Provide a list of active patients that show whether or not they received Zoster shots

-- Filter: Active patients should be alive, and must have had an encounter within the last five years, between 2017-2021.

-- Note: Shingrix, a zoster vaccine, was approved on October 20, 2017. However, sales didn't really start until 2018.
-- Shingrix is a two-dose series. We'll just tally patients who received at least one dose.
-- Patients who were previously vaccinated with Zostavax were eligible to get the new Shingrix vaccine. 
-- In 2017 and 2018, both vaccines were available for a short time, and it's hard to tell which brand was given.
-- For the purposes of this project, we will only be looking at patients who got vaccinated between 1/2018-12/2021.

-- Filter: Patients must be at least 50 years old to be eligible to receive a Shingrix Zoster Vaccine in a community pharmacy setting in Massachusetts.

-- Let's start. Here's a common table expression, followed by the columns I'm looking for.

with zoster_shot as
(
	select patient, min(date) as earliest_zoster_shot
	from immunizations
	where code='121' --filters for zoster vaccines
		and date between '2018-01-01 00:00:00' and '2021-12-31 23:59:59' --filters for 2018-2022 only
	group by patient --eliminates duplicate patientids
)

select pat.birthdate
	,extract(Year FROM age('2021-12-31',pat.birthdate)) as age
	,pat.race
	,pat.county
	,pat.id
	,pat.first
	,pat.last
	,pat.gender
	,zosters.earliest_zoster_shot
	,case when zosters.patient is not null then 1 -- this helps us add up the number of zoster shots
		else 0 -- replaces character 'null' with an integer 0
		end as rec_zoster_shot
from patients as pat
left join zoster_shot as zosters
	on pat.id = zosters.patient

-- Let's look at the entire patients table again..

select * from patients

-- Need to filter out the dead patients.

-- Let's look at the encounters table...

select * from encounters

-- Need to filter out patients who have not had an encounter for more than 5 years.
-- Starting from the beginning...

with active_patients as -- making two total common table expressions
(
	select distinct patient
	from encounters as e
	join patients as pat
		on e.patient = pat.id
	where start between '2017-01-01 00:00:00' and '2021-12-31 23:59:59' -- this filters for the active pts
		and pat.deathdate is null -- this filters out the dead patients
		and EXTRACT(year from age('2021-12-31',pat.birthdate)) >= 50 -- only age 50+ approved for zoster vaccine
),

zoster_shot as -- syntax: take out the 'with' because it's the second table expression
(
	select patient, min(date) as earliest_zoster_shot
	from immunizations
	where code='121'
		and date between '2018-01-01 00:00:00' and '2021-12-31 23:59:59'
	group by patient
)

select pat.birthdate
	,extract(Year FROM age('2021-12-31',pat.birthdate)) as age
	,pat.race
	,pat.county
	,pat.id
	,pat.first
	,pat.last
	,pat.gender
	,zosters.earliest_zoster_shot
	,case when zosters.patient is not null then 1
		else 0
		end as rec_zoster_shot
from patients as pat
left join zoster_shot as zosters
	on pat.id = zosters.patient
where 1=1 -- this is just a placeholder
	and pat.id in (select patient from active_patients) -- this is a subquery

-- Note, this data shows that only people aged 50-55 received a zoster vaccine! I added an additional 50 shots to random patients.
